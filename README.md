Instagrabber is a very simple application created in Java that allows you to download any Instagram picture. Not much needs to be said. Simply paste the Instagram picture URL, press GO and that's it. 

This will only work for instagram.com. This will not work with any other sites. In the future I might add other social media platforms, but for now it's just Instagram.
